Chapter 1 overall doesn't do very much interesting other than introduce us to javascript so theres not to much to say here.

Javascript is a language that we will be using so we must learn it

It is built on a compiled connection of global variables called the Global Object which is the main reason it is often so yelled at and inoptimal. However there are tools to undo this bad thing

#### Very Good Parts of JS
- functions
- loose typing
- dynamic objects
- expressive object literal notation
