Chapter 1 overall doesn't do very much interesting other than introduce us to javascript so theres not to much to say here.

Javascript is a language that we will be using so we must learn it

It is built on a compiled connection of global variables called the Global Object which is the main reason it is often so yelled at and inoptimal. However there are tools to undo this bad thing

#### Very Good Parts of JS
- functions
- loose typing
- dynamic objects
- expressive object literal notation

#### The Author Loves Railroad Diagrams
For each section there will be a railroad diagram representing the grammar

How to interpret the diagrams:
- Start on the left edge and follow the tracks to the right
- Literals in ovals
- Rules or Descriptions in rectangles
- Any sequence of characters that can be made by the tracks are legal
- Any diagram with one bar at each end allow whitespace to be inserted between any pair of tokens, railroad diagrams with two bars at each end do not
