## Databases
#### Aspects of Databases
- Structure

- Effeciency

#### How does serialization effect Database efficiency 
- Serialization helps data integrity
	- Creates consistent data
	- Won’t be overwritten deleted or edited without our permission
- Serialization of data helps consistency of interpretation, makes it so we know how our data is going to be always
- Serialization gives different amounts of efficiency of operational and spatial
