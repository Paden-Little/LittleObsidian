## Interactive Web Dev
#### What is Javascript?
- Javascript is a scripting language primarily developed for interactive websites
- A scripting language is **not compiled** and instead interpreted by an engine.
	- If run from a website it’s interpreted in the browser 
	- Node.js for example is a removed from browser interpreter for javascript
#### Console.log
```Javascript
console.log(“Print something to the log”)
```
- `console.log()`  is a method that takes any type of object and any number of objects and prints whatever data it can find to the console
#### Functions
```Javascript
function doSomething(firstNumber, secondNumber){
	return firstNumber + secondNumber
}
```
- The function signature is like the “name” of the function, the actually name, here “doSomething” then the parameters, here “firstNumber, secondNumber”.
- Whenever this function is called it takes what you give it, does stuff then either ends or returns
- For this example it takes the two numbers and adds them together and returns them
- **NOTE**: We have no way to guarantee what we get from the method caller is a number, it could be any object
- ##### Function = defintion
	- Functions can also be defined as a variable 
```JavaScript
var doSomeMaths = function(firstNumber, secondNumber){
	return firstNumber + secondNumber
}
```
- Doing a function definition this way makes it so that we have more control over the function
	- This allows us to define a function that is only executable in a certain scope, meaning garbage collection removes the variable reference and all the function code whenever we leave the scope
	- It also allows us to make a function call non-global. If we define a function normally anywhere in the script we can access it anywhere else in the script, with this notation we can only access that function after the variable for it is declared. 
		- This means we can also change the function as our script is executed. If after a condition is met or after a certain point in the code we could reassign the variable holding the original function, to an entirely new function that changes anything about the function to fit our needs
