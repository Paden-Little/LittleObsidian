Letâ€™s say we have a while loop
```python
i = 0
while I <2;
	print(i)
```
This will print 0, then 1, then the program will end

However we can also add a else statement which will execute whenever the while condition naturally evaluates to false, so we can use this as a way to signal the end of a while loops execution
```python

```
