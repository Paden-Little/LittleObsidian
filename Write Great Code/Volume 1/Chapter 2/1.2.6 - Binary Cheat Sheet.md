- You can tell if a number is even or odd based on its last digit
    - $1010$ - Even
    - $0101$ - Odd
- If the $n$ LO bits are $0$, then the number is even divisible by $2^n$.
    - $1\_0011\_0101\_0000$ - This number is evenly divisible by 16
- If a binary number has a 1 in bit position $n$ and zeros everywhere else, that value is equal to $2^n$
    - $1000\_0000$ - Equal to $2^7$ or $128$
- If a binary value has all 1s up to (and not including) bit position $n$ then that value is equal to $2^n-1$
    - 0111_1111 - Equal to $2^7-1$ or $127$
- Shifting all the bits in a value to the left by one position multiples the value by $2$
- Likewise, Shifting all the bits in a value to the right divides by $2$
    - Note that if the number is not even their will be a loss of data in this process as you will be shoving a bit off the edge.
- Multiplying 2 binary numbers of $n$-bits might take as many as 2 times $n$ to store the value
- Inverting all the bits (flipping $0$s to $1$s and $1$s to $0$s) is the same as multiplying by $-1$ and subtracting $1$
- Adding $1$ to to the largest unsigned binary value for a given number of bits always produces $0$
- Subtracting $1$ from an unsigned binary value of $0$ always generates the largest unsigned binary value
- An $n$-bit value provides $2^n$ total combinations of bits
